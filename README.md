# Artemis School Management System
My Matric 2021 I.T PAT (Practical Assessment Task) Project

## About
This is the client side desktop application of my Artemis School Management System which I created for my 2021 Matric IT PAT. The backend it interacts with is a REST API written in the Django REST Framework for Python (a framework for Django). It can be found here [link placeholder]

## Dependencies

This project uses the gradle build system for managing all required libraries. All required libraries can be found in this repository's "build.gradle" file

**WIP**
