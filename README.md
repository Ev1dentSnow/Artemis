# Artemis School Management System
My Matric 2021 I.T PAT (Practical Assessment Task) Project

## About
This is the client side desktop application of my Artemis School Management System which I created for my 2021 Matric IT PAT. The backend it interacts with is a REST API written in the Django REST Framework for Python (a framework for Django). It can be found here [link placeholder]

## Dependencies

This project uses the gradle build system for managing all required libraries. All required libraries can be found in this repository's "build.gradle" file

**WIP**

## Acknowledgements

Although the actual coding part of this project was done by myself, would like to pay tribute to three people in particular who helped in various ways

- @MikeRomaa for showing me the ropes around Django and the Django Rest Framework for the backend. He's a real expert at this framework with a lot of experience under his belt       with it, and helped me to understand many concepts

- @liamdp for helping me wrap my head around the concept of A RESTful API and some RESTful "best practices". This is certainly one of his areas of expertise

- @gavinvangent for sharing his experience with real world databases, and spending some time showing me some best practices for creating SQL relations.
